# Pinvou CodeWhale Fork Policy

> Updated: 2026-09-08. Public PR candidate based on upstream `v0.9.12` r1; the protected maintenance branch and immutable r1 tag are not published yet.
> Canonical Chinese policy: [`docs/fork-policy.md`](fork-policy.md). This English page is a condensed summary; the Chinese version is the complete, authoritative process.

## Baseline

- Upstream: `Hmbown/CodeWhale` `v0.9.12` at `dcd4c200f72f0c1ffd60d8e7f6850313db879fc5`.
- Public PR candidate: `codex/pinvou-v0.9.12-r1` in CodeWhale PR #44, currently at `ff299f94b0795180c76d0336152385dbd02dfa05`, with eight signed commits.
- The public pre-upgrade rollback point is immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r13` at `f853f8f1566c57e6be40d5439a222a932aa79ef5`; local `backup/pre-v0.9.12-sync` at the same SHA is only a convenience ref.
- The r1 candidate branch is public for review, but is not yet the protected consumable baseline. Only after explicit authorization should `Pinvou/CodeWhale:pinvou3-clean` and immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.12-r1` be aligned to the candidate head.
- Keep exactly four long-lived topics:

  1. Host embedding and routing boundary
  2. Tool compatibility and command-execution safety
  3. Embedded context and Skill sources
  4. Automation and runtime lifecycle

The exact commits and fingerprints are recorded in [`docs/fork-modifications.md`](fork-modifications.md).

## Rules

- Prefer the app bridge, bundle instructions/Skills, MCP/connectors/plugins, then an upstream contribution. Keep a fork patch only when the behavior must be atomic inside CodeWhale's Engine, SubAgent, Task, or Automation lifecycle.
- Product tool policy, UI, workspace selection, and business routing stay in `pinvou3-app`.
- The soft drift limits remain 1,500 net added lines and 200 fork-distinct lines per file. The v0.9.12 r1 candidate is 72 files and `+4848/-637` (net 4,211), down from v0.9.5 r13 at 110 files and `+10895/-1195`. Newly touched files include equivalent release-lint adjustments, review-requested result-level lifecycle and evaluation regressions, and the API-search fallback reachability fix; they add no fork behavior topic. The remaining excess is justified by Engine/Task-atomic steer, final-dispatch security, host prompt/profile/Skills ownership, Automation lifecycle behavior, and their safety tests. Upstreaming priority is generic steer and per-turn security first, Automation lifecycle second, parent migration to narrow re-export APIs followed by retirement of the 18-module compatibility facade, then replacement of prompt/profile/Skills ownership with stable host APIs.
- Fixups are squashed into their owning topic; no long-lived catch-up commit chains are maintained, and generic host configuration, routing, tools, Automation, and OAuth must remain within their owning boundary.
- A fork-distinct change must update the modification register and guard fingerprints, include a result-oriented `forkguard_*` test where applicable, and pass `./scripts/fork-guard.sh --fast`.
- For a large upstream refactor, clean re-fork from the release tag and re-express each surviving topic. Do not preserve merge-conflict batches as long-lived history.
- Candidate review branches may be pushed for a PR. Update the protected maintenance branch and create an immutable tag only after explicit authorization. The published tag, maintenance branch, and parent gitlink must resolve to the same commit.

## Required verification

```bash
./scripts/fork-guard.sh --fast
cargo check --manifest-path CodeWhale/Cargo.toml -p codewhale-tui --lib --locked
cargo test --manifest-path CodeWhale/Cargo.toml -p codewhale-tui --lib --locked \
  forkguard_ -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --manifest-path CodeWhale/Cargo.toml -p codewhale-tui --lib --locked \

Automated gates do not replace real-model, GUI, MCP/OAuth, and scheduled-task acceptance.
