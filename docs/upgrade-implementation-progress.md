# Upgrade implementation progress

Task source: [V1.0 development tasks](pinvou-upgrade-platform-development-tasks.zh-CN.md).
Tasks are completed individually only after in-scope independent code review,
repairs, applicable tests and commit/push. Contract completion is not production
client, service, physical platform certification or rollout readiness.

| Task | Status | Delivery / outstanding dependency |
|---|---|---|
| T01 | Implemented; independently reviewed and verified | Executable metadata/credential Schemas, byte/trust profile, reference verifier, independently verified fixed vectors and local CLI E2E |
| T02 | Implemented; independently reviewed and verified | Closed control APIs, publication/lifecycle/selection/quality reference models and regression tests; no production service implementation |
| T03–T47 (including final T43) | Not completed | Follow the task graph; no runtime or certification completion is claimed |

Confirmed implementation decisions (2026-10-09):

- Ed25519; initial Root 2-of-3, other roles initially one valid signature; scoped configurable roles and separate high-risk dual approval.
- Metadata 1 MiB, credentials 64 KiB, depth 32, decoded string 64 KiB, per-container 4,096-member bounds.
- Service/admin engineering is in the separately selected **UpdateServer repository**. Go + Gin + pgx + PostgreSQL 17 and React + TypeScript + Vite are approved; PostgreSQL durable jobs/transactional outbox, OIDC with community self-hosted Keycloak, and separate signing/file-storage ports follow that choice. Its private address stays in local Git configuration. Production provider/deployment details remain pending. No server project is created here.

T01 adds Ajv 8.20.0 only to the isolated contract package; dependency audit reported
no vulnerabilities at installation. Desktop behavior and runtime dependencies are
unchanged. Future service tasks cannot be marked complete through client fixtures.

The first implementation batch safely merged the then-current origin/main and
aligned CodeWhale with the parent gitlink. Continue task/review work on that base
without repeatedly syncing merely because main advances.

T01 validation: 41 tests passed on Node 22 and the current local Node release;
the architecture guard passed. Both independent reviewers rejected the first
implementation, the primary role repaired every finding, and both passed the
second review. Python independently verified all 20 fixed envelopes, signing
inputs, hashes and Ed25519 signatures. No production service, desktop update
workflow, installer or physical platform certification is claimed.

A parallel review run exposed a 15-second CLI subprocess test timeout; isolated
and serial reruns passed. The test-only subprocess allowance was raised to 60
seconds and rechecked. It does not set a network or download time limit. Remaining
tasks retain their dependencies, including production infrastructure decisions
that will be supplied later. The separate backend repository is now selected.

T02 validation: 167 tests passed on Node 22 and Node 26, including local CLI E2E,
legal transitions, binding failures, expiry equality and atomic race regressions.
Both independent reviewers passed the fifth frozen code review after the primary
role repaired all findings. Each independently ran the Node 26 suite and the
architecture guard. Generated OpenAPI 3.1 and closed Schemas match their sources;
an independent YAML parser resolved all 1,425 local references across 37 paths
and 146 bundled Schemas. Diff whitespace checks passed.

T02 freezes API contracts, owner projections, final guards and atomic reference
models. It does not implement a database, production signing or authentication,
real helper/launcher, desktop upgrade workflow or physical OS certification.
Download handoff and credible progress/waiting remain independent of session
expiry; there is no total or cumulative download deadline.

T03 still requires approved OS certification coverage, all-user/service data
scope and finite preparation budgets. The product owner approved local health
criteria, strict trustworthy time option A and the Go backend stack on 2026-10-09,
and requested the platform/data inventory and measured-budget test proposal in
[implementation decisions](upgrade-implementation-decisions.md).
That document distinguishes approved policy from proposals and physical evidence.
Normal offline retention across shutdown also needs a proven trustworthy elapsed-time mechanism under
the current strict requirement. Ordinary OS clocks or powered-on TPM clocks
alone do not demonstrate elapsed shutdown duration. OS/data scope and concrete
budget approvals, and time-implementation evidence, remain pending. No support
restriction or retention-policy change is assumed approved.
