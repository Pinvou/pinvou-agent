# Upgrade implementation progress

Task source: [V1.0 development tasks](pinvou-upgrade-platform-development-tasks.zh-CN.md).
Checkpoint: **2026-10-23 23:42 Asia/Shanghai**.

There are 47 tasks: six completed, twenty in progress, twenty not completed,
and T42 explicitly deferred. The strict completion ratio is **6/47 (12.8%)**.
The equal-task engineering estimate is **34.0%**. T31 is updated in this batch;
other estimates retain their 2026-10-22 assessment. These estimates are not
measured hours or release readiness.

## Delivery rules and active work

**T31 Windows helper/launcher host is implemented and pushed** in `18a241e1a`.
The next main task is **T29 download and protected byte handoff**. Its fixed
control caller and protected staging work share this task's boundary; T07/T08
remain parked because their missing active publication/first-activation owners
cannot be replaced by the existing genesis-only sources. Work on one main task
and at most one direct prerequisite; other incomplete tasks are parked. Parallel roles
implement, independently review, test and integrate this same task. Reuse reviewed
foundations and test tools; review changed behavior and its impact after repairs.
Do not start a fresh runner or historical evidence-review chain for a small patch.

Environment-only E2E failures or unavailable environments do not block task
completion, commits or pushes. Record the cause, unexecuted scenarios and follow-up;
never label them passed. Functional failures must be repaired and verified.
Clean task-owned environments promptly after successful tests only when they are
no longer needed, all owned processes/handles have closed, and exact paths have
been verified. Preserve essential results and shared or unrelated resources.

Independently usable components may be committed after their own review and
applicable checks. A component, source review, build or single-platform test does
not complete its enclosing task. T42 deployment and T03's 50 GiB / 500,000-file
measurement remain explicitly deferred. Downloads have no fixed total deadline.
The 32 MiB limit applies to joined business metadata, not package downloads.

## Completed T31 delivery

- Standalone helper and stable launcher, authenticated fixed-action IPC, native
  scope/identity checks, registration CAS, takeover/fencing primitives, controlled
  restart handoff, app wiring and explicit lab/production packaging are integrated.
- The no-argument `helper --install-local` entry requires an already elevated local
  administrator and the complete local package. It validates held file bytes and
  PE resources, creates a fixed protected source with native creation ACLs, then
  starts only its retained installer. Partial/different source is refused and
  preserved. Existing installation repair requires the original exact source.
  It does not authorize a metadata upgrade or prompt for elevation.
- First intent, immutable metadata/preparation genesis and original Root bytes
  commit in the same native registry transaction. Readback verifies the complete
  scope-bound state; retries never reset epochs, Root or missing records. Root
  signatures at signed issuance prove anchor integrity only, not current metadata
  qualification or trusted current time. Unavailable T32/T36 handlers refuse.
- Scoped independent source review, repair review and T31 task-coverage review
  passed. Current Rust tests: **host 74 passed / one existing ignored; metadata
  owner 6 passed; ownership 4 passed; custody 2 passed**, zero failures. All owned
  processes closed naturally and resource guards remained satisfied.
- Packaging/startup contracts: **114 tests; 111 passed, zero failed, three native
  opt-in tests unexecuted**. Normal and embedded production profile checks passed.
  A fresh current-source dev build produced both actual standalone roles; PE
  gates verified System32-only dependent-load policy and absence of dynamic CRT
  imports. The real helper public-profile command passed. Two actual CLI controls
  refused invalid local arguments and unavailable metadata authorization with
  their exact expected exit codes. These are lab artifacts, not a shipping release.
- The three additional approved app lock edges passed an isolated Windows compile
  probe. OAuth2 and serde-saphyr used the app's resolved Windows feature sets;
  iana-time-zone was checked explicitly although absent from that active graph.
  The probe verified all three exact selected dependency versions. This is not a
  whole-application build. Existing package versions/checksums were preserved;
  the app added only the two internal owner packages.
- Rust formatting, locked dependency resolution, whitespace and architecture
  checks passed. The first SHA formatting compile error was fixed and the failed
  run retained. Earlier Node summary-parser, MSVC teardown, low-RAM refusal,
  ambiguous dependency selection, Cargo subset-selection panic and UTF-8 setup
  failures remain diagnostic history, not successful tests.

Environmental E2E gaps: isolated guest SCM install/repair/removal, ordinary-user
and multi-user entry, recovery after process death/revival and reboot remain
unverified. Native compiler/signature opt-ins lack directly reusable qualified
inputs. Record these as follow-up scenarios, not passed tests. Under the owner's
explicit policy these environment gaps do not block T31 completion or delivery.
The implementation does not complete T26/T27/T28/T32/T36 or system acceptance T43.

Cleanup pending: the successful isolated dependency probe's disposable build
target and temporary directories are no longer needed. Automatic approval review
blocked their recursive deletion with no more specific reason. They are retained;
essential logs, probe inputs and reusable host artifacts remain available.

File distribution separates policy/control from immutable package data. T09/T18
still need complete OSS/COS adapters and switching acceptance: preserve package
identity, size and SHA-256, verify migrated bytes, and retain old paths for active
or resumable downloads. This remains queued, not a second active development task.

## Current T29 increment

The explicit QA/support cache tool now obtains DownloadInfo through the fixed
control POST. It verifies the original Decision before sending, then correlates
both response credentials and the exact Package before opening a new payload.
One real job writer stays held across POST and GET. Supplied time remains a QA
observation; no current qualification or immutable-source continuity is invented.

Independent scoped source review passed. Windows regression: download workflow
22 library and two process tests passed; control transport three passed / one
opt-in ignored; native inspection two library and thirteen process tests passed /
three existing opt-ins ignored. Final invocations all closed naturally with no
resource-floor failure. Earlier compilation invocations with a leftover MSVC
telemetry process failed the whole-process gate and remain failed history; a
cache-hit rerun established natural closure without discarding compiler outputs.
No registry package version/checksum changed in the two affected locks.

Protected byte staging is now implemented in the Windows host. Ordinary borrowed
file/metadata inputs grant no trust: compiled Seed/Root establish the exact
Package context, and only that verified Package supplies artifact/native claims.
The host creates a fresh fixed protected leaf, copies and completely verifies
the package and selected native member, closes writers and reopens the same
objects through held ancestry. The resulting capability offers bounded reads
and cancellable full rechecks, with no path, handle, launch or install interface.
The byte capability alone is not a VerifiedExecutionObject or current
installation qualification.

The next delivered component wraps that capability in a real same-process
`VerifiedExecutionObject` after another complete physical recheck. Its generation
contains both actual file identities, including creation fields, and the entire
authenticated Package/compiled Seed binding. Read-only references do not grant
authority. Handoff consumes the unique owner and rechecks the exact reference
and physical objects while retaining all original handles; an action borrow
likewise keeps the same owner alive. There is no path/handle/launch interface,
cross-process transfer, restart adoption, current qualification or install grant.
Object custody does not require or create a preparation/freeze lock.

Independent deep and repair reviews passed, including fixes for cooperative
cancellation, genuine threshold/signature controls and a private Artifact type
import. The object-ownership increment also passed independent deep review with
no findings. The host depends on narrow byte/archive libraries rather than the QA
workflow or its HTTP stack. Latest Windows host tests: **88 passed, zero failed,
one existing opt-in ignored**; this includes four genuine Root/Package binding
controls and five pure object-generation/transition tests. One compile-fail
doctest passed, proving the moved old owner cannot be reused. These pure tests do
not manufacture a native sealed capability or replace physical E2E.
Native-evidence sources were unchanged during these final increments;
their preceding qualified **9 library + 2 process** passes are reused, with one
existing opt-in ignored. The preceding protected-staging increment built both
standalone binaries; byte-matched independent artifact copies passed PE
loader/static-runtime gates, and the actual helper's public profile command
passed. The subsequent ownership-only API adds no dependency or loader change.
Rust formatting, normal lock resolution,
whitespace and architecture checks passed. Existing registry package identities
and edges are unchanged; the app lock only adds internal host dependency edges.

First compile invocations with lingering MSVC telemetry failed process closure;
unchanged cache-hit retries passed with natural closure. A direct PE check on
Cargo's hardlinked cache output refused as designed; independently copied and
byte-verified artifacts passed the same unchanged gate. These failed invocations
remain diagnostic records. No resource-floor failure occurred.

Actual protected-copy ACL/reparse, replacement and disk-exhaustion E2E remain
unexecuted without a qualified isolated Windows input/environment; they are
environment follow-ups, not passed tests or completion blockers. Current
production qualification, source continuity/continuation and integration with
the later authorized executor remain unfinished business implementation. The
existing DownloadInfo wire lacks an authenticated immutable-source object/version
binding; a compatible extension is awaiting the owner's decision. No ETag or QA
provider assertion is promoted to a production continuity proof. These increments
do not complete T29; its engineering estimate remains unchanged pending closure.

## Per-task status

Only T31 changes from the previous estimates. Outstanding environment-only E2E qualification is not a

## Historical evidence

The full earlier progress record is preserved byte for byte in
[history through 2026-10-23](upgrade-implementation-progress-history-20261023.md).
Its old blocker wording reflects the rules at those checkpoints; the current E2E
policy takes precedence. Detailed evidence remains there so routine progress
updates do not grow the active summary again.
